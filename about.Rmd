#### Users
Our main users would be Commuters and Government Agencies. Commuters can look into the app and get a rough picture of how crowded the location would be and decide if they would like to drive or use a tram or a train. Government Agencies, on the other hand, can predict the demand in public transport over time based on these variables and estimate a course action.

Other potential users include the Police Force, Ambulances and PTV. The Police can estimate traffic volume and enforcement. Ambulances can predict the volume of patronage within an area and choose the best route to take. PTV can predict the number of commuters and decide if they would like to use an extra train/tram to accommodate the number of passengers.

**With more open data from PTV(Myki Touch ON/OFF which will only exist in the future), Weather(BOM), Traffic, & etc., more accurate insights can be obtained.**
