### Welcome!

The goal of this app is to address some of the problems of commuter herding behaviour in Melbourne.

For some commuters, waking up to a cold, wet morning may convince them that driving to the CBD is better bet than walking 15 minutes to the train station.
This is fine, but the herding behaviour may result in too many cars on arterial roads, rendering taking public transport a faster option.
The opposite may happen, and too many people take to the public system, resulting in overcrowding of trains.

This app seeks to help:

* Commuters decide whether to drive to work, or take to the public transport system
* Emergency services decide whether to deploy more services to the roads/train Stations
* Public Transport Victoria to decide whether to deploy more ad hoc services

#### Shiny
This is a Shiny App, and so is both browser and mobile friendly!

### Navigation
To use the app, use the navigation icon in the top-left corner.


#### Analysis

This page shows some simple analysis conducted on the data used for this app.


#### Prediction

The Prediction page is designed for users to predict what traffic / public transport conditions will be like, based on weather forecasts.

The prediction is done based on the following linear model,

E(Transport) = Weather variables + Time variables 

where weather variables include:

* Max temperature
* Min temperature
* Rainfall
* Day of the week
* Month


#### Map

The goal of this page is to allow users to select particular train stations to see patronage trends, and future predictions.


#### Data Sources

This page lists the data that we have used for the GovHack2016 competition.

#### Code

Code for this Shiny App can be found in UI, Server and Global pages in the navigation bar.

Source code for the Shiny App and GovHack data can be found in the
[GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewManHayChiu/GovHack2016) link.
